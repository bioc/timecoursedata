Description: This data package contains timecourse gene expression data sets.
	     The first dataset, from Shoemaker et al, consists of microarray
	     samples from lung tissue of mice exposed to different influenzy
	     strains from 14 timepoints. The two other datasets are leaf and
	     root samples from sorghum crops exposed to pre- and
	     post-flowering drought stress and a control condition, sampled
	     across the plants lifetime.
